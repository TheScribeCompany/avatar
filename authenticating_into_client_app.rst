6. Authenticating into a client app
===================================

Authenticating into a client app is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting access to the app's features and services. 
This typically involves entering credentials such as a username and password, or using biometric methods like fingerprints or facial recognition, 
to ensure secure and personalized user access. 
Authentication helps protect sensitive data, prevents unauthorized access, and enhances the overall security of the app, 
ensuring that only legitimate users can interact with the application.
