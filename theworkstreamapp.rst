2. The WorkStream App 
======================

Avatar is a decentralized privacy-first Identity ecosystem that solves the privacy issues of using emails and phone numbers as identifiers by using 
unique biometric-based identities. 

Foundational principles of Avatar: 
Biometric identity: One identity per person 
Identity System Operator: Avatar Inc will never have access to personal information. 
Cryptographic keys: Identities are transformed into anonymous, revocable, and portable cryptographic keys. 

The Avatar's Work Stream App allows IT admins to sign up their company to be an Avatar customer and invite employees by sharing the link. 
A new customer can sign up on the company's website and mobile app using Avatar, and existing customers can migrate to logging in with Avatar on the website and mobile.
